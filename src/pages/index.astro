<Layout title="Berk Çebi">
    <p>Hey, I'm Berk. <span id="emoji"></span></p>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer and one of the co-founders of
        <a href="https://zeplin.io">Zeplin</a> — you can reach me at
        <a href="https://twitter.com/berkcebi">@berkcebi</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently released one of my side projects,
        <a href="https://peel.fm">Peel</a>. It's a little drum machine in your
        browser.
