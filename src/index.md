Hey, I'm Berk. {{ ["🐠", "🥭", "🏺", "🧤", "🥛", "🥥"] | random }}

I'm a software engineer and one of the co-founders of [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io) — you can reach me at [@berkcebi](https://twitter.com/berkcebi).

I recently released one of my side projects, [Peel](https://peel.fm). It's a little drum machine in your browser.

<!-- Oh, hello. If you're into game development, you can also find some of my work at GitHub: https://github.com/berkcebi -->
